# VersionModule

This directory provides the `VersionComponent` that renders release
version and date information.

Its features include:
  * initially the component displays the current version, release date, and update 
    date (if present) in a single line
  * the version includes an "expand" widget that opens a listing of the version history
  * if the version being viewed is not the latest, a link appears to the latest
